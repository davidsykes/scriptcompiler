I wouldn't have thought you could manage memory better than the system, but you know the Amiga better than me.

What sort of values do you need for the script variables? The current systems allow integers and strings.
Strings are a problem because they can either point to static strings, or dynamically allocated memory.
Will all the scripts be loaded into memory and kept in a static location? If the only strings are those
in scripts then they are just pointers. If strings need to be created then the system needs to know
when they should be freed.

Local and global script variables also need considering.
Script variables were separated into local and global variables so that any script could be run
by multiple objects at the same time, each keeping their own local values.
Is that no longer the case? Do all scripts refer to the same set of global values?





If script variables are not declared how can global variables be diferentiated from local variables?

What values can fn routines return? Only integers or can strings be returned?
If strings can be returned are they static of allocated on the heap?

What string values can script variables have?
Are the all string values goint to be pointers to static areas of memory?
Can string values be modified, or just set?

When retrieving a global or local value is a copy or pointer required?
If a pointer then what if the value is changed elsewhere?
If a copy then how is it disposed of or stored?
