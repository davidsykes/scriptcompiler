Script variables were separated into local and global variables so that a script could be run
by multiple objects at the same time.
So two characters could run the same action script but have their own state values.
Is that no longer the case? Do all scripts refer to the same set of global values?



If script variables are not declared how can global variables be diferentiated from local variables?

What values can fn routines return? Only integers or can strings be returned?
If strings can be returned are they static of allocated on the heap?

What string values can script variables have?
Are the all string values goint to be pointers to static areas of memory?
Can string values be modified, or just set?

When retrieving a global or local value is a copy or pointer required?
If a pointer then what if the value is changed elsewhere?
If a copy then how is it disposed of or stored?
