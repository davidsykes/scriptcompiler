The system is organised into a ScriptSystem which processes the scripts,
and one or more ScriptRunningInstances which manage the state for an ScriptRunningInstances

The ScriptSystem consists of
    VariablesManager - handling global variables
    FnRoutinesCaller - handling the fn routines
    ValueStack       - used during the script processing, but should always be empty between script calls

The ScriptRunningInstances consists of
    ProgramCounter   - handling the location in the current script
    VariablesManager - handling variables local to the instance
